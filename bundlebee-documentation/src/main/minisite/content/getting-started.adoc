[abstract]
BundleBee is a light Java package manager for Kubernetes applications.
This page explains how to get started with it.

== Installation

=== Java  Mode

. Ensure to use java >= 11.0.7 (previous Java 11 versions can work but have an issue with TLS HTTP client you can hit).
. Download the `bundlebee-core` fat har:
. You can now run it with the command: ``.

=== Binary

IMPORTANT: as of today, no release of BundleBee are on central yet so this script does not yet work.

IMPORTANT: this only works for linux amd64 computers.

[source,sh]
----
curl https://yupiik.github.io/bundlebee/install/install.sh | bash

== Create your first alveolus

=== Pre-requisite

BundleBee assumes it is installed itself indeed but depending how you package your alveolus it can require Java (>= 8) and Maven.
If they are not installed on your system, we encourage you to use link:https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] to do so.

TIP: this can be replaced by any zip packager and is not a strong requirement.

[[start_with_maven]]
=== Start with a maven project

There are a ton of ways to create a maven projects but here is the simplest one:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=com.company \
    -DartifactId=my-app-alveolus \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 \
    -DinteractiveMode=false
----

Then you can go in `my-app-alveolus/`.
You can run `mvn package` to ensure your java/maven setup is correct.

At that stage we can start working on our alveolus but if you want to be "purist" you can clean up the default skaffolded project: `rm -Rf src/test/ src/main/java/`.

To start working on our alveolus, we will create `src/main/resources/bundlebee` folder: `mkdir -p src/main/resources/bundlebee`.

At that stage your project should look like:

[source]
----
.
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        └── resources
            └── bundlebee
----

To describe an application, you have to create a `manifest.json` file in this `bundlebee` folder:

[source,json]
.src/main/resources/bundlebee/manifest.json
----
{
  "alveoli": [
    {
      "name": "hello",
      "descriptors": [
        {
          "name": "hello-world"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

And add the referenced Kubernetes descriptor in `kubernetes` subfolder:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/bundlebee/kubernetes/hello-world.yaml
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-deployment
  labels:
    app: hello
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello
          image: hello-world:latest
          envFrom:apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-kubernetes
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-kubernetes
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-kubernetes
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-kubernetes
        image: paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
----

Now you can install your alveolus: `mvn install`.

This will create a `target/my-app-alveolus-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file which is the entry point to deploy your application.

Now you can deploy this executing `bundlebee apply --from com.company:my-app-alveolus:1.0-SNAPSHOT` --descriptor hello.

And that's it, now hello world application should be up and running in your Kubernetes cluster.

TIP: it is more than encouraged to name the kubernetes descriptor based on the project unique identifier.
For example `<groupId>.<artifactId>.<alveolus_name>.yaml`.
It will avoid conflicts when multiple alveolus are in the same classpath using native java mode and not file driven mode.

=== Start from scratch (without Java and Maven)

In this part we will reuse the descriptors of xref:#start_with_maven[Start with maven] section so we will just show how to bundle without Java/Maven the alveolus.

The overall goal is to create a zip containing the `manifest.json` and the Kubernetes descriptor.
Here is a small script helping to do that:

[source,bash]
----
#! /bin/bash

base="my-app-alveolus" <1>
mkdir -p "$base/bundlebee/" "$base/bundlebee/kubernetes/" <2>
----

<.> The name of the project (will create a root directory with this name)
<.> Create the alveolus structure

Now you can copy the descriptors as in xref:#start_with_maven[Start with maven] section in `my-app-alveolus/bundlebee/` folder.

Once done we just have to bundle it as a zip. One option on UNIx system is to use this command:

[source,bash]
----
#! /bin/bash

base="my-app-alveolus" <1>

cd "$base"
zip "$base.zip" -r . <2>
----

<.> Reuse the same setup than in previous script
<.> Create a zip containing the alveolus structure using `zip` command

And that's it.

TIP: this trick to create a zip can be adapted to any language (javascript, typescript, go, python, ruby, ...) and enables to bundle an alveolus in any build tool very easily.
