= User Configuration

BundleBee supports a user configuration.
It means you change some defaults for your local setup creating a file `~/.bundlebeerc`.

The syntax is a standard properties one.

Here are the supported configurations:

include::content/_partials/generated/documentation/bundlebee-core.adoc[]

TIP: this also applies for command configuration so you can also force some defaults for your most used commands this way.

== Custom configuration

You can also set a custom configuration file using `--config-file`.
This enables to run a command with a custom set of configuration:

[source,bash]
----
bundlebee --config-file mysetup.properties command --myarg value
----
